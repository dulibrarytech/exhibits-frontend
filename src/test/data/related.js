During World War I, Max served as a doctor for four years with the rank of a commissioned officer. He cared for German troops on the front lines, on both the Eastern and Western fronts in Galicia and France. Max was awarded the Iron Cross First Class for his bravery. In 1919 he settled in Berlin, where he specialized in dermatology and venereal disease.</p><p>It was in Berlin that Max met Maria Steinberg (née Bäetge), a widowed artist raising a daughter, Karin, from her first marriage. Max and Maria married in 1925, had a son Henry (Heinrich), and built a life together. The two remained in Berlin throughout World War II, surviving the Holocaust and several attempts to transport Max to Eastern death camps.</p><p>After the War ended, the couple and Karin immigrated to the United States in 1946, making their new home in Williamsport, Pennsylvania. Max died not two years later, on February 3, 1948.</p>",

As a young woman, Maria studied art in St. Petersburg, Russia, where she met her first husband, Erich Steinberg, an architect. He served in the Russian army as an architect designing buildings on the Sweaborg Island Fortress in Helsinki's harbor. Maria and Erich were married in 1914, and Maria gave birth to their only child, Karin, in Helsinki, Finland in 1915. In 1917, as the Russian Revolution began, the Steinberg family escaped to Germany. When Erich died in 1920, Maria moved to Berlin where she could support herself and Karin working as an artist and designer. Maria met Dr. Max Loewenstein and they were married in January of 1925. Maria and Max had one child together, a son they named Heinrich, later known as Henry. Maria and her daughter Karin suffered persecution and the dangers of living in a Jewish household during World War II.</p><p>After the war, the Loewensteins immigrated to the United States. Once in America, Maria (called “Mautzy” by her children) changed the spelling of the family name “Lowenstein,\" dropping the first “e” in \"Loewenstein\" to \"make things easier for our American friends,\" as she put it. However, she made a point of refusing to change the obviously Jewish last name that had made her the subject of persecution. She said, “I have suffered with this name, and I am proud of it.” She became a well-known artist and teacher in both Pennsylvania and Colorado.

Two days later, Henry went back to check if the Nazis had been in the apartment. Then, with his mother, loaded a box with the family silver and tried to leave it with Aryan friends until things calmed down. “We pushed the box around on my bike for several hours, but no one wanted to open their door for us, being more concerned with their own safety,” recalled Henry.</p><p>Following Kristallnacht, Jews were required to carry identity cards issued by the Gestapo. Dr. Max Loewenstein and Henry were issued their cards at Gestapo headquarters on March 31, 1939 in Berlin. For Henry it was a significant moment as he watched his father, who had always been a commanding presence, endure the insults screamed at him by the Gestapo's bureaucrats. Henry later recalled that this was the moment he truly realized the hopelessness of the family's situation.</p><p>Jews, desperate to leave Germany, Austria, and occupied Czechoslovakia, were only allowed to take a very small amount of money out of the country. Other countries, still struggling to feed their own people at the end of the Great Depression, could not afford to take these penniless refugees. Henry's cousin, Ingrid Lind, was lucky enough to have Danish citizenship and escaped to Denmark. When the Germans occupied Denmark in 1940, she escaped alone to Sweden and Finland. At age nineteen, she crossed Russia into the Middle East on foot, where she joined the British Army.</p><p>Max had previously applied for visas to the United States and investigated other emigration options for the family, but nothing appeared to be possible for at least another three years. Jews were not likely to be able to survive that long under Nazi rule. The family barely survived in Berlin until the end of World War II.</p><p>Henry was able to escape to England through a British refugee program known as the Kindertransport.</p>",

        "text": "<p>In early February 1939, Herr Rosenberg, one of the few teachers still at Wilsnacker Strasse Jewish School, asked Henry to stay after class. He told Henry that he knew of a committee that would sponsor one boy for admittance to England. Kristallnacht had prompted a wave of British sympathy for the suffering of the Jews under Nazi rule, and refugee aid groups had successfully persuaded Parliament to admit an unspecified number of Jewish children, if a £50 bond was posted for each child. Between December 1, 1938 and September 1, 1939, a series of trains, ships, and planes brought approximately 10,000 Jewish children into England. The program eventually became known as the Kindertransport.</p><p>Henry's mother Maria applied immediately, and received a letter a few weeks later announcing Henry's acceptance into this program. It took several months for the committee to handle all the paperwork with both British and German governments, but on May 29th the Loewensteins received a letter with Henry's travel date - June 5, 1939. Thirteen year old Henry and his family knew that his move to England would save his life, but it also meant a wrenching separation from his family. Max and Maria hoped that it would not be long before the whole family could leave Germany. However, the war broke out within 12 weeks and the family would be separated for eight years, the only communication coming infrequently through the Red Cross.</p><p>Henry spent two months in a refugee camp, then briefly attended a school in London, before being evacuated with all of London's children into the countryside on the eve of war. He ended up in Whipsnade, a beautiful English village, adjacent to a branch of the London Zoo, where he soon found part time work while attending the village's one room school. Later he worked on a farm and served with the British Home Guard until the end of the war.</p><p>A plaque, thanking the British Parliament for enabling 10,000 Jewish children to escape to England in 1939, was donated in 1999 by Kindertransport survivors and is prominently mounted adjacent to the entrance of the House of Commons.</p>",

Nearly all Polish, German, and Austrian Jews who remained in their countries perished. In other occupied countries, about a quarter of the Jewish population survived. Nazis also targeted the mentally and physically disabled, gypsies, Soviet prisoners of war, homosexuals, Polish and Soviet citizens, political opponents, religious dissidents, and those whose behavior did not match prescribed Nazi social norms.</p><p>Frequent air raids were systematically destroying Berlin. Surviving among the ruins, the Loewensteins did as much as they could to help their friends. Maria welcomed displaced individuals like Monica, the daughter of a deceased Jewish mother and a fanatic Nazi father, into their home. Maria also sent food and packages of necessities to family and friends who had been sent to ghettoes (Max’s brother Georg and sister-in law Alice) and concentration camps (family friends the Eylenburgs).</p>",

After the Netherlands fell to Germany, Erna was on one of the first transports to the Auschwitz Concentration Camp and was murdered there in 1942.

Doctors Ernst and Elisabeth replied with three pre-printed cards of thanks, the only form of communication allowed the prisoners of Theresienstadt. Due to examination by prison guards, each card is postmarked several days or weeks after the date of the card.</p><p>In August 1944, Dr. Elisabeth found a way to smuggle out an actual message to the Loewensteins. In it, she thanks them for their package and manages to sound positive, reporting that her husband is well and her son has grown almost as tall as his father. That message, dated August 5, was written in response to a package received on July 11, and is postmarked August 31. The final card received from the Eylenburgs, is signed in a weak hand by Elisabeth and dated September 22, 1944. This was the last the Loewensteins heard from them.</p><p>Dr. Ernst and Walter Eylenburg were taken to the Auschwitz Death Camp and, according to the Central Database of Shoah Victims' names, murdered soon thereafter. Dr. Elizabeth Eylenburg was taken to Auschwitz a short time later and also killed.</p>",

She had been aware for some time that her husband, Dr. Max Loewenstein was addicted to morphine and she now insisted that something had to be done about it.</p><p>Max’s addiction began as the result of a foot injury he sustained in 1933 while hiking with friends in the Harz Mountains in Southern Germany. Believing it to be a bad sprain, he refused X-rays and prescribed himself morphine for the pain. Too late, Max learned that his foot had been fractured and could no longer be set properly. Over the years, the break continued to cause Max pain, and he became addicted to the morphine. Maria had wanted Max committed to a drug rehabilitation facility for years.</p><p>Finally, on September 25, 1941, Max agreed to admit himself to the Wittenauer Sanatorium in Berlin. Three weeks later, the Nazis began massive sweeps of Berlin’s Jews in which many, including Max’s brother Georg and sister-in-law Alice, were transported to the Łódź (Poland) and Riga (Latvia) ghettoes or to concentration camps in Poland. Many died there of starvation. Any survivors were later taken to Auschwitz and killed.</p><p>Maria visited Max while he was in Wittenauer, but pretended not to know where her husband was when the Nazis came looking for him, endangering herself to protect him. Max was discharged from Wittenauer in April 1942. Thankfully, the Nazis’ push to remove Berlin’s Jews had temporarily slowed down. Those seven months saved his life, not only in treating his addiction to morphine, but from almost certain death at the hands of the Nazis.</p>",

        "text": "<p>Thousands of Jews had already been killed when the infamous Wannsee conference took place in January of 1942. It was then that fifteen top Nazis met to finalize plans for the systematic annihilation of the Jews with industrial efficiency.</p><p>Dr. Max Loewenstein was still in the Wittenauer Sanatorium when the major roundup of Berlin’s Jews began. Several thousand men, women, and children (including Max’s brother Georg and sister-in-law Alice) had been sent to the Łódź and Riga Ghettos, or taken to concentration camps. Construction of the death camps was almost complete, making it possible to murder many thousands each day. An incredibly evil and efficient method was now used to gather up Berlin’s Jews for transportation to the East.</p><p>After Kristallnacht, the Nazis had taken over Jewish cultural organizations, forcing them to do their “dirty” work. They now used these organizations' staff and letterhead to send Nazi orders to Berlin’s Jews. In 1942, the Nazis used the Jüdische Kultusvereinigung zu Berlin e.V., one such organization, to send “Eviction Notices” to every Jewish household in Berlin, including the Loewensteins.</p><p>Everyone in the household, without exception, was ordered to appear at a designated time and location. An estimated 60,000 Jews who obeyed the order to appear were packed in cattle cars under the most inhumane conditions and sent to the death camps to be gassed. This “notice” was, in effect, a death warrant. This document is extremely rare – almost everyone who received it was sent to the Auschwitz death camp. Those who dared to ignore it would not have carried this order with them, since that alone would have meant instant death if caught.</p><p>When Maria received the order, she pretended not to know where Max was, refused to vacate the apartment, and appealed the order to the local Building Department. She produced transcripts of her parents’ marriage certificate, her birth and baptismal records to prove her Aryan heritage and receipts and bills to prove residence at her address. The order was temporarily rescinded, most likely the only time that happened.</p><p>Max was discharged from the Wittenauer Sanatorium in April 1942. Thanks to Maria’s courage and quick thinking Max had escaped deportation.</p><p>Max had to report to the police after leaving the Wittenauer Sanatorium, and both he and Maria were assigned to work at forced labor. Maria had to work a twelve-hour night shift sewing military uniforms, and Max was made to work twelve hours each day, sorting shoes and other personal possessions that came back from the death camps by freight car loads.</p><p>Karin continued to work for an insurance company during the war until air raids and the Russians advances made that impossible.</p>",

On the morning of February 27, 1943, the Nazis proceeded to arrest them. Those Jews who had German relations were crammed into Rosenstrasse (Rose Street) 2-4, an empty factory building that had previously housed Jewish community offices and was a place where the Nazis gathered Jews about to be transported.</p><p>Maria returned home from her night shift that Saturday morning to learn that Max had been taken. She found out that he was being held at the Rosenstrasse address and hurried there to discover about a hundred non-Jewish women demanding to see their husbands, or at least to find out what their fate was to be.</p><p>The Nazi guards, used to dealing with helpless Jewish families, did not know how to respond to these insistent German women, whom they could not so easily bully into submission. The wives stood their ground, crying out: “If you take them, you must take us!” and refused to disperse. Most, including Maria and Karin, stayed on for the next five days, their numbers swelling into the thousands.</p>",

Joseph Goebbels, Minister of Propaganda and Gauleiter (Governor) of Berlin, was keenly aware that Germany had suffered enormous military defeats in recent weeks. Estimates vary, but they had lost at least 500,000 men in the battle for Stalingrad. British Field Marshal Montgomery had just driven Rommel’s army across North Africa, inflicting many casualties.</p><p>Goebbels, concerned about German morale, did not want to see a massacre of German women in the center of Berlin, where it could not be covered up. He gave the order to release all Jews who had a non-Jewish spouse waiting for them, noting that deportations could easily resume in a few weeks, when it would be more convenient. Approximately 2,000, including Max, were released. All others were taken to the gas chambers at Auschwitz. Thus Max escaped deportation once again, but knew that they might come for him at any moment.</p><p>On March 2, 1943 the British began their nighttime “1,000 bomber” raids, and the U.S. Eighth Air Force soon followed with its massive daylight raids on Berlin. Max and Maria welcomed these raids despite the dangers from the falling bombs, because that was the only time when they did not have to fear the Nazis.</p>",

Of the more than 160,000 Jews in Berlin before Hitler came to power, few were still alive. The city lay in ruins and feeding the population was a huge challenge. The victorious Russians wanted Germany to care for the needs of Berlin’s civilian population, but wanted to be sure that no Nazis would be involved.</p><p>Otto Grotewohl had lived in the rear of the Loewensteins’ apartment building when Henry was a child and had served in the Reichstag before Hitler came to power. He was one of the few anti-Nazis with administrative experience who had survived the Hitler era. He began by first organizing food distribution in the immediate neighborhood and soon handled all of Berlin and much of what was to become the East Zone.</p><p>With her clear anti-Nazi past, Karin became hisassistant and soon dealt on his behalf withrepresentatives of the Western Powers. Her maincontact with OMGUS, the Office of the MilitaryGovernment of the United States in Berlin, wasDenver native Dick Sears, who played an importantrole in the family’s later lives. Grotewohl soonbecame the leader of the Social Democratic Party inGermany and eventually the Prime Minister of EastGermany. Under Soviet pressure he met secretly inFebruary/March 1946 with the leader of the GermanCommunists, Wilhelm Pieck. Only Karin was present to take notes as the two leaders planned to betray the Western Powers. She passed the information to her American contacts, was taken prisoner by the Russians, escaped, and her American friends arranged for her, Max and Maria to leave as quickly as possible for safety in the United States.</p>",

International aid organizations and concerned individuals on the ground moved to assist the victims of Germany’s crimes against humanity and reunite separated families. All of Germany began the long process of rebuilding. The Loewensteins were officially recognized as Victims of the Nuremburg Laws.</p><p>The Loewensteins had only had three communications in the last five years with Henry in England. Neither he nor his family knew of each others’ fate. Six weeks after the end of the war Maria learned that a British delegation had arrived in Berlin. She set out on foot across the city’s ruins to see if she could find someone who could get word to her son in England. At British headquarters a soldier was standing guard in front of the building. Maria spoke very little English so he directed her to go up the stairs to a room where a British officer sat behind a desk. He spoke fairly fluent German. Maria asked him how she could make contact with her son in England from whom she had not heard in years. He asked her for her son's name and address. She told him: \"Henry Loewenstein in Whipsnade, Bedfordshire.\"</p><p>He asked her to repeat what she had said, to be sure he had heard it right. He then got up, walked around the desk and told her that he had seen Henry just the previous week and that Henry looked well and happy. Major Blythe, Henry’s neighbor in Whipsnade, was probably the only person in the entire British Army who knew Henry at that moment. t was indeed miraculous that Maria had met him on her first try amidst all the millions of people who had been shuffled around and displaced by the war.</p>",

The Allies did not want Nazis involved in the new government; however, Hitler had killed most known political opponents. Britain and the United States wished to create a democratic government in Germany, while the Soviet Union wanted to establish a Communist state under their control.</p><p>Otto Grotewohl, a former neighbor to the Loewensteins who Henry had known as a child, had served in the Reichstag before Hitler came to power and had subsequently been imprisoned several times. Grotewohl lived very quietly until he was involved in the failed attempt to assassinate Hitler in 1944, when he became a hunted man. As one of the few anti-Nazis with political and administrative experience to survive the war, he emerged to take charge of distributing food and services in his immediate neighborhood. Very soon, he was handling distribution in all of Berlin and throughout Germany and became the leader of the newly formed Social Democratic Party.</p>",
